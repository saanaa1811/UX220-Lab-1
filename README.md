## Hi my name is sanaa and the favorite thing i wrote was:

### The favorite thing i wrote was a letter to my mom even though she doesn't like being 
### emotional person yet I wrote her one on the day I moved out .
### It's the best thing to most of us because we fail to express 
### our feelings out loud instead putting our thoughts into words.
### It was my favourite because I expressed out a lot without even having to face her
### but by just handing over a small letter and sprinting away
